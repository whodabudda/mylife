# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

       text: >
        Before you create your account, you will see the splash screen.
        Nothing is enabled other than the About and Doc menus. In the top right, you will see a message 
        'Please Sign-Up or sign-in'. Click on that link to continue using the app.

        On the log in page, if you already have an account, you can put in your email, a username, and password and log in.
        You can recover from a lost/forgotten password, providing the email for your account is still valid. If you have 
        lost/forgotten your password AND no longer have the email for the account, you will need to send an 
        email to whodabudda@gmail.com for support.

       heading: Metrics and Events
       text: >
        The site is designed to enable you to capture data about things that you measure (the Metrics), and things that 
        you do (the Events).  For example, if you want to measure your blood pressure, that would be a Metric (actually one of
         the pre-configured Metrics in the system).  Then if you want to see what effect some activities have on your blood pressure,
        those are considered 'Events'.  Events could be anything from eating a salty meal, jogging for an hour, going to the Gym, or even 
        sitting around doing nothing.  When you chart a Metric or Event, you need only assign a value, and if necessary adjust the date 
        and time that it occured.
        <ul/>
        It is helpful to view the number associated with an Event or Metric in terms of their Units.  Blood pressure is always 
        understood in terms of atmospheric pressure, or milligrams of mercury (mm).  Any event that doesn't have a 
        standard unit should have one defined for it that makes sense to you.  For example, sleep.  You may want to define your
        quality of sleep as a scale of 1 to 10 ("1 <> 10").  
        <ul/>
        You can define your own Metrics/Events, and Units.  They can't be the same names as the pre-configured ones.  Select
        the 'Manage Content -> Metrics' menu.  The pre-configured Metrics are listed first.  You cannot change these. Whatever 
        Metrics you define will be listed under these, and will have an Edit and Destroy link under the Actions heading.
        <ul/>
        To create a new Metric/Event, use the 'New Metric' link under the list of Metrics.
        <ul/>
        The same design appears for the 'Manage Content -> Units' menu.
        <ul/>
        One last comment on creating Metrics and Events.  They are both confusingly called Metrics, but are differentiated under the 'Type' heading.
        There can be a grey area around Metrics and Events, where something you measure can also be something that happens. 
        For example Pain.  It can be something you measure against going to the Gym, and can also me something that causes 
        your blood pressure to rise.

       heading: Charting
       text: >
        To add data points, use the table at the top of the Home page.  
        The table has columns for Metric, Value, Units, Datetime, and then 3 links for deleting, editing, and copying the row.
        <ul/>
        The easiest way to add a point is to use the '+' icon. That creates a new row identical to the row you were on. You can 
        then change the Metric and Value to be the new point you want to add.
        <ul/>
        The pencil icon for editing will bring up a form window for editing the fields, but I think its easier to just edit
        them in place.
        <ul/>
        Metric has a drop-down list to choose from.  Units are filled in automatically.  The Value is self-explainatory, but 
        it should make sense in the context of the Metric.  Very large numbers can throw the chart off if the charting item is
        defined as Metric (as opposed to Event).  Metrics are displayed as lines on the graph.  Events are displayed as icons.  Hover over the icon to
        see the actual value, however for charting purposes, we display the Event as its Standard Deviation for all charted values
        of that event.
        <ul/>
        If it looks like the chart is not in synch with the table, use the 'Refresh Chart' button.

        <ul/>
        If you want to see only one Metric/Event, use the Filter button.

        <ul/>
        The legend at the bottom of the chart allows you to filter what you see in just the chart. 

        <ul/>
        The Set Extremes button allows you to select a date range for the chart.  This can help visualize the data when
        it becomes crowded with a lot of points.


     "placeholder5":
       heading: Analysis
       text: >
        So what do we do with this data?
        Basically, we just look for correllations.  We want to see if there is a relationship between the Metrics and Events.
        
        <ul/>
        To do that, go to the 'Analysis' menu.

        <ul/>
        There you will see that last Regression Chart that you saved.

        <ul/>
        This chart is a Regression calculation based on the the data points of the chosen Metric and Event over the same time period
        <ul/>
        The Metric is the 'dependant' variable, and is the coordinate on the Y axis (vertical).  The Event is the X variable and listed
        the coordinate on the X axis (horizontal).  

        <ul/>
        You provide the Metric, Event, a date range for when the Metric was measured and the Event occurred, and a time span 
        that indicates the proximity you want for these two coordinates.  

        <ul/>
        For example, ;you want to see a regression for how your jogging affects blood pressure from June to December, where the 
        BP was measured with 48 hours of the jog.  Measurements that meet this criteria will be grouped into a point on the graph,
        and a regression line calculated and displayed.

        <ul/>
        If you judge the relationship to be significant, you can check that box.
        <ul/>
        You can save the Analysis for later review.
