//The layout has the framework for the modal. new.html.erb has content_for blocks to provide header and body
//content, which should make the layout generic for all modals.  You must have a div with modal-holder on the page
//this is launched from.  Since this is launched from the navbar, which includes the application layout where 
//modal-holder is defined.  Also note that the template: parm is used with render, meaning that if you give the  
//path to the view, it will use the full template, not the partial.

$("#modal-holder").html("<%= escape_javascript(render template: 'units/new',formats: [:html], layout: 'layouts/modal') %>")
$('#exampleModal').modal("show")

//Had a great deal of trouble getting both jquery and bootstrap modal function to work. 
//bootstrap defines the modal function, and somehow attaches it to jquery.
//It never worked with the ES6 import, but seems to be working now using 'require' for bootstrap
//Rails doc says not to use ES6 methods with ujs because ujs does not pre-process.  Yeah, that explains so much.

//
//Here are some troubleshooting things to try if it goes south again.
//
//console.log("the element is: " + document.querySelector('#exampleModal'));
//let mynewmodal = new Modal(document.getElementById('exampleModal'));
//console.log("mymodal is: " + mynewmodal)
//mynewmodal.show();
